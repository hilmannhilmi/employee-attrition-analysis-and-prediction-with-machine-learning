# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Description
In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to analyze and predict employee attrition using a rich dataset featuring 1470 observations and 35 variables. I initiated the task with data preprocessing, where I identified and removed irrelevant features, thus streamlining the data for more effective analysis. Following this, I embarked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover the intrinsic patterns and relationships between different features, including the high correlation between certain variables and how they could potentially influence attrition rates.

Recognizing the issue of imbalanced data distribution, I leveraged the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance the data quality, facilitating more reliable predictive modeling.

In the modeling phase, I explored various algorithms including Random Forests and Gradient Boosted methods. Through iterative fine-tuning, I achieved an optimum predictive model with a remarkable 98% accuracy using the Gradient Boosting technique.

Utilizing Jupyter Notebook and Python, coupled with various machine learning libraries, I managed to develop, fine-tune, and evaluate predictive models, thereby demonstrating the prowess in machine learning and data analysis.
